# ShikshaVaani 🎙️📚  
Offline Voice-Based Science Learning App (Hindi + English)

## Overview
**ShikshaVaani** is an offline-first, voice-based science learning app designed for rural students (Class 6–8).  
It reduces learning barriers caused by:
- Poor/unstable internet connectivity  
- English-only, text-heavy learning platforms  
- Difficulty in understanding concepts through reading alone  

The app supports learning through **audio + video lessons**, voice interaction, and simple voice-assisted quizzes.

Many rural students struggle to access quality education because most online learning platforms:
